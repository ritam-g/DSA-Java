//NOTE - 🧩 Problem: Find the Rotation Count in a Rotated Sorted Array (PROBLEM NO 1)

A sorted array of distinct integers is rotated at some unknown pivot index.
For example, the sorted array [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7] might become [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2] after rotation.

Your task is to find the number of times the sorted array has been rotated.
Formally, return the index of the smallest element in the array.

✳️ Example 1

Input:
arr = [15, 18, 2, 3, 6, 12]
Output:
2

Explanation:
The original sorted array [2, 3, 6, 12, 15, 18] was rotated 2 times.
The smallest element 2 appears at index 2.

✳️ Example 2

Input:
arr = [7, 9, 11, 12, 5]
Output:
4

Explanation:
The smallest element 5 is at index 4.
Hence, the array was rotated 4 times.

✳️ Example 3

Input:
arr = [7, 9, 11, 12, 15]
Output:
0

Explanation:
The array is not rotated at all, so the smallest element 7 is at index 0.

🧠 Constraints

1 <= arr.length <= 10^5

All elements in arr are distinct

arr is a rotated sorted array
