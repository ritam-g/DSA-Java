//SECTION - 744. Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target

You are given an array of characters letters that is sorted in non-decreasing order, and a character target. There are at least two different characters in letters.

Return the smallest character in letters that is lexicographically greater than target. If such a character does not exist, return the first character in letters.

Example 1:

Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "a"
Output: "c"
Explanation: The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'a' in letters is 'c'.
Example 2:

Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "c"
Output: "f"
Explanation: The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'c' in letters is 'f'.
Example 3:

Input: letters = ["x","x","y","y"], target = "z"
Output: "x"
Explanation: There are no characters in letters that is lexicographically greater than 'z' so we return letters[0].

                              //NOTE - ANSWER
//NOTE - NO NEED TO RETURN  THE TARGET ELEMENT IF IT MATCH WITH IDEX OF ARRAY 
//NOTE - JUST RETURN WHICH IS GETTER THAN AND NEARCST OF THE SELECTED ARRAY 
//NOTE - WRAPED IF NO GRTER VALUE IN ARRAY THEN RETURN ARR[0]

//SECTION - 34. Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array
Given an array of integers nums sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.

If target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
Output: [3,4]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6
Output: [-1,-1]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [], target = 0
Output: [-1,-1]
 

Constraints:

0 <= nums.length <= 105
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
nums is a non-decreasing array.
-109 <= target <= 109

**Quick Checks — Why Two Binary Searches?**

1. One binary search → finds **only one** occurrence.
2. We need both **first** and **last** positions → use two searches.
3. `findFirst()` → keep going **left** until previous ≠ target or index = 0.
4. `findLast()` → keep going **right** until next ≠ target or index = end.
5. If only one search used → may stop in the **middle of duplicates** (wrong range).
6. Example: `[5,7,7,8,8,8,10]`, target=8 → single search may return index 4, but correct range is `[3,5]`.
7. Both searches = `O(log n)` each → total still **O(log n)**.

**In short:**
🧠 One search = one target.
✅ Two searches = complete range.
