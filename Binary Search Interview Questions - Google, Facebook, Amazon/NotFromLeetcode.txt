Given a sorted array which is infinitely long (you do not know its size),
find the index of a given target element using minimum comparisons.

arr = {10,20,30,40,50};
target = 40;

// NOTE - sorted → use Binary Search
// We cannot use length function
// So start = 0 and end = 1 and keep doubling end → O(log n)
